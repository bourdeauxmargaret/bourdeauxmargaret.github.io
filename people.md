HSPA is hosted by the Division of Global Health Equity at the Department of Internal Medicine at MassGeneral Brigham. Our leadership and associated faculty hold dual roles: as academic researchers at leading universities and research institutions, and also as practitioners serving in public sector roles or providing direct clinical care to patients. In addition, we teach and mentor a diverse group of students, ranging from undergraduates to graduate students, fellows, and post-doctoral researchers, from around the world.
