Health Security Policy Academy (HSPA) is a policy-focused initiative that develops practical health security analysis, governance options, and implementation-ready guidance. Our work is designed to help decision-makers connect evidence, operations, and policy choices under real-world constraints.

## Our Story
Harvard and its affiliated institutions are home to a vibrant global health community with a longstanding record of innovation, partnership, and commitment to advancing human health worldwide. The global health movement has helped drive extraordinary gains—expanding access to lifesaving care, strengthening delivery systems, and accelerating the development and distribution of medical innovations. Yet sustaining those gains requires more than scientific progress and programmatic investment. It requires health security policy: the work of safeguarding progress by strengthening the resilience of health systems, improving the operational pathways through which medical innovations are produced and delivered, and preventing and mitigating health crises before they materialize.

HSPA was created to address these needs. Seated in the Division of Global Health Equity in the Department of Internal Medicine at MassGeneral Brigham, HSPA strives to advance MGB’s core mission of providing world-class care, research and education to advance human health. The Academy serves as a platform for practitioners and researchers to build policy fluency, connect with experienced policy leaders, and convert field-based learning into actionable policy insight. Over the years, we have iterated and refined our approach—strengthening our curriculum, partnerships, and methods—to better equip our community to engage effectively in health security policymaking.

## Why Policy and Practice Must Connect
Frontline practitioners often generate insights with direct relevance for policy—revealing where systems break down, where implementation falls short, and what reforms are most urgently needed. Yet too often there are limited pathways for practitioners to inform the policies shaping the environments in which they work. At the same time, many members of our community lack access to practical education and mentorship on the policy landscape—how decisions are made, where influence is concentrated, and how to translate evidence into action.

## How We Work
### Framing and scoping
We explore the policy and governance context of a health secur ity issue,  identifying the stakeholders, administrative and decision-making processes, and policy levers that can drive change. Products of this work may include quantitative analyses of policy impacts, research reviews, and case studies. 

### Stakeholder engagement
Policy analysis and formulation are best done ‘in community’, where all stakeholders can inform the discussion. HSPA convenes stakeholders and facilitates dialogue through multiple forums, including roundtables, workshops, working groups, and conferences. In addition, we regularly engage policy makers in bilateral dialogue regarding legislation relevant to health security, respond to federal agency Requests for Information, and present in global health security forums, summits and conferences.

### Solution iteration and testing
Some proposed solutions, particularly those involving system redesign or changing the cay stakeholders engage with one another, lend themselves to design workshops, table tops; stress-tests, and simulations to test and refine them. We work with emergency operations managers and state and global leaders to design and develop these exercises.  When then beta-test products in real-world scenarios to further refine recommendations and tools.  We continue to assess impacts of these products and resulting policy changes over time. 

### Dissemination
We generate potential policy and governance options, tools, frameworks, and data analysis programs to address health security policy problems. We solicit feedback from the stakeholder community on the feasibility and effectiveness of these products. 
Students, including Harvard University undergraduates, graduate students from HKS, HLS, HMS, and HSPH, and postdoctoral fellows participate as researchers in all our initiatives.
