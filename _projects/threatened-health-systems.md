Threatened Health Systems examines how conflict, climate shocks, displacement, and governance stress affect system function and service continuity. The project prioritizes practical indicators that can signal elevated risk before visible collapse occurs.

Analysis integrates service delivery, financing, and workforce data to map fragility and identify where policy support can preserve core capacity. The intent is to help decision-makers intervene earlier, with interventions matched to real implementation constraints.

Findings are translated into concise products for planning and oversight audiences that need usable recommendations, not abstract diagnostics.
