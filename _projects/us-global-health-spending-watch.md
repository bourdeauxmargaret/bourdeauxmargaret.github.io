U.S. Global Health Spending Watch is a public dashboard designed to support policy analysis, accountability, and advocacy by making federal global health spending patterns transparent and accessible. It helps decision-makers, journalists, advocates, and the public see where U.S. global health commitments are made, how they change over time, and which agencies and programs are driving those shifts. The dashboard is built on underlying financial data drawn from public U.S. government sources, including federal spending and accounting systems. Rather than relying on budget announcements or policy statements, it shows how funds are actually obligated and distributed in practice. These data reveal which organizations receive funding, what types of activities are supported, and how priorities differ across countries and technical areas. By comparing stated policy goals with observed spending patterns, the dashboard makes it possible to assess whether U.S. global health investments align with stated objectives — and where gaps or inconsistencies may exist.
