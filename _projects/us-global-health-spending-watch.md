US Global Health Spending Watch tracks how US federal resources for global health are allocated, obligated, and executed across agencies and accounts. The project is built to make complex budget structures usable for policy teams, implementing partners, and oversight audiences.

The work combines appropriations analysis, account-level crosswalks, and year-over-year comparisons to identify both shifts and continuity in spending patterns. It is designed to surface tradeoffs early, before key policy and planning decisions are locked in.

The project also supports rapid-response analysis during major fiscal events, including supplemental requests, rescissions, and reprogramming actions. Outputs are formatted for practical use in briefing materials and internal planning cycles.
