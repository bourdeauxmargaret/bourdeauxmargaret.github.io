Drawing the Line defines decision thresholds for when elevated risk should trigger specific policy, operational, or financing actions. The project clarifies what counts as sufficient evidence for escalation in uncertain and rapidly changing environments.

The research develops practical threshold frameworks that can be applied across agencies and partner organizations, with explicit treatment of uncertainty, lagging indicators, and implementation costs.

Outputs are designed for planning cycles, tabletop exercises, and after-action improvement processes where clearer trigger logic can improve coordination and speed.
