Project TransFORM develops policy and financing pathways to improve outbreak readiness and response performance. The project centers on translating technical goals into implementable reforms with clear accountability and measurable outputs.

The work links governance design, funding mechanisms, and operational readiness requirements so recommendations remain executable under real-world institutional constraints. Comparative case analysis and structured policy testing are used to evaluate feasibility and likely effect.

TransFORM products are designed for agency, legislative, and partner audiences that need decision-ready options for near-term action.
